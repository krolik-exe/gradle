[[upgrading_version_7]]
= Upgrading your build from Gradle 7.x to the latest

This chapter provides the information you need to migrate your Gradle 7.x builds to the latest Gradle release. For migrating from Gradle 4.x, 5.x, or 6.x, see the <<upgrading_version_6.adoc#upgrading_version_6, older migration guide>> first.

We recommend the following steps for all users:

. Try running `gradle help --scan` and view the https://gradle.com/enterprise/releases/2018.4/#identify-usages-of-deprecated-gradle-functionality[deprecations view] of the generated build scan.
+
image::deprecations.png[Deprecations View of a Gradle Build Scan]
+
This is so that you can see any deprecation warnings that apply to your build.
+
Alternatively, you could run `gradle help --warning-mode=all` to see the deprecations in the console, though it may not report as much detailed information.
. Update your plugins.
+
Some plugins will break with this new version of Gradle, for example because they use internal APIs that have been removed or changed. The previous step will help you identify potential problems by issuing deprecation warnings when a plugin does try to use a deprecated part of the API.
+
. Run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version {gradleVersion}` to update the project to {gradleVersion}.
. Try to run the project and debug any errors using the <<troubleshooting.adoc#troubleshooting, Troubleshooting Guide>>.

[[changes_7.1]]
== Upgrading from 7.0 and earlier

=== Deprecations

[[jacoco_merge]]
==== JacocoMerge task type is deprecated

The `JacocoMerge` task was used for merging coverage reports from different subprojects into a single report.
The same functionality is also available on the `JacocoReport` task.
Because of the duplication, `JacocoMerge` is now deprecated and scheduled for removal in Gradle 8.0.

[[configuring_custom_build_layout]]
==== Setting custom build layout

Command line options:

* `-c`, `--settings-file` for specifying a custom settings file location
* `-b`, `--build-file` for specifying a custom build file location

have been deprecated.

Setting custom build file using
link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.GradleBuild.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.GradleBuild:buildFile[buildFile]
property in link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.GradleBuild.html[GradleBuild] task has been deprecated.

Please use the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.GradleBuild.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.GradleBuild:dir[dir]
property instead to specify the root of the nested build.
Alternatively, consider using one of the recommended alternatives for
link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.GradleBuild.html[GradleBuild] task as suggested in
<<authoring_maintainable_build_scripts#sec:avoiding_use_of_gradlebuild, Avoid using the GradleBuild task type>> section.

Setting custom build layout using
link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.StartParameter.html[StartParameter] methods
link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.StartParameter.html#setBuildFile-java.io.File-[setBuildFile(File)]
and
link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.StartParameter.html#setSettingsFile-java.io.File-[setSettingsFile(File)]
as well as the counterpart getters
link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.StartParameter.html#getBuildFile--[getBuildFile()]
and
link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.StartParameter.html#getSettingsFile--[getSettingsFile()]
have been deprecated.

Please use standard locations for settings and build files:

* settings file in the root of the build
* build file in the root of each subproject

For the use case where custom settings or build files are used to model different behavior (similar to Maven profiles),
consider using <<build_environment#sec:gradle_system_properties, system properties>> with conditional logic.
For example, given a piece of code in either settings or build file:
```
if (System.getProperty("profile") == "custom") {
    println("custom profile")
} else {
    println("default profile")
}
```
You can pass the `profile` system property to Gradle using `gradle -Dprofile=custom` to execute the code in the `custom` profile branch.

==== Cleanup of the `org.gradle.util` package

Despite being an internal package, the `org.gradle.util` package is used by several Gradle plugins. In Gradle 7.1 we cleaned up the package, marked
the accidentally exposed classes as deprecated, and set them for removal in Gradle 8.0. The following classes are now deprecated:

- `VersionNumber`
- `TextUtil`
- `WrapUtil`
- `RelativePathUtil`
- `DistributionLocator`

=== Potential breaking changes

The following classes have been removed from the `org.gradle.util` package:

 - `TreeVisitor`
 - `Mark`
 - `IncubationLogger`
 - `AntUtil`
 - `JarUtil`
 - `NoOpChangeListener`
 - `DeferredUtil`
